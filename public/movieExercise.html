<h1>The Best Movie According to Natan Neil</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Anime of all-time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Overlord</h3>
<p>The genre of this anime is isekai and a little bit of action
    and comedy. I like the story where the main character want 
    to dominate the world but not using violence as the first 
    choice but through a diplomatic way</p>

<h3>That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime</h3>
<p>The genre of this anime is also isekai. The main character is 
    a slime and we all know that slimes are one of the weakest mob 
    character in fantasy stories. But Rimuru (the main character) is
    one of the strongest character even though he is a slime. He can
    even beat some demon lord on thelatest season of it.

<h3>The Rising of the Shield Hero</h3>
<p>The story of revenge. One of my favorite story/ novel where the main
    character is fooled by the princess of the kingdom. He was looked as 
    a criminal in the kingdom due to the plot and scheme of the princess
    but as the story progress, he showed his innocence and the princess, along
    with the king are punished by the queen.
